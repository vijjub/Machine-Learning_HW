Documentation for the Homework 1:
--------------------------------------------
Name : Vijendra Kumar Bhogadi
UTA-ID: 1001052460

There are two python scripts attached 
1) bhogadi_data_partition.py -- Running this code will distribute the data into test and training with 50:50 split
2) bhogadi_naivebayes.py -- Running this code starts the actual impleemtatin of the algorithm

Execution Details:
------------------

To run the code just open with 'Python Idle' which is a builtin python ide and run.
All the directory names or filepaths in the scripts must be replaced with the directory names or paths on your local machine otherwise an error will be raised

Implementation Details:
-----------------------

1) Constructed a vocabulary of unique words with sklearn.feature_extraction library
2) Stemmed and removed stop words from the vocabulary
3) Computed the prior probability of each class
4) Computed the probability of each feature(word) in a particular class and constructed a matrix of that respect to each class
5) For each test document, Computed a likelihood estimate and applied log to the product of probabilities to avoid getting a zero
6) Wrote the results to a text file which is also attached 
7) Calculate accuracy
8) Accuracy is --- 83.48%
